Hello and welcome to my new blog! I'm excited to share my journey from the maritime world to industrial automation and my cultural adventures. This blog will highlight technical insights from my work commissioning material testing equipment, gas turbines and PLC systems, as well as reflections on life between Sweden and Southeast Asia. Stay tuned for stories, tutorials and travel experiences!

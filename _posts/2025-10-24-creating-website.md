On LinkedIn, I shared my experience building a personal website using React and a UI library. The process taught me how coding can be a form of self-expression. I discussed choosing technologies, designing a dark-themed UI and customizing it to reflect my personality. I also invite feedback and suggestions from the community. If you're interested, check out my portfolio site at https://nj22az.github.io/blog/ for examples of my work.
